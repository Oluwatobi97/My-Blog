        I’m Tobi Siyanbola, a Lagos-based web developer with 3 years of
        experience specializing in building responsive, engaging web
        applications. With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React,
        Tailwind CSS, and WordPress, I focus on crafting seamless user
        experiences that look great on any device.
        <br /> I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from ESGT
        University in the Republic of Benin, and I’m passionate about
        translating ideas into functional, visually appealing websites. I
        believe in clean, maintainable code, and I’m committed to continuous
        learning and improvement.
        <br /> In addition to working on freelance projects, I’m eager to join a
        collaborative team where I can apply my skills, tackle new challenges,
        and learn from experienced developers. If you’re looking for a driven
        web developer with a strong grasp of modern front-end technologies,
        let’s connect!
